- 👋 Hi, I’m @cclawhon
- 👀 I’m interested in video games and design and dev to spark curriculum into scintillation!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything (inc. git, ssh, godot 4, gd script, blender, terminal, homebrew, etc)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you will help me with lol
- 📫 How to reach me? At Work: cc.lawhon@epiccharterschools.org  or At Home Studio: info@cclawhon.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: cows make me sad, glitter makes me happy

Everything in my gameDev folder is copyrighted 2024 no copy/share/do not use. However, I'll be showing parts of my game in a public repository which are either someone else's (sharealike) or parts of my work you're welcome to use and change to fit your needs! When I learn something I think would help others, I'll either put a mini-tut on reddit (@OhEvolve) or I'll add a repository for it, make a YouTube short, or I'll link to it :)
