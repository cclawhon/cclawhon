- 👋 Hi, I’m @cclawhon an educator with a mission to create curriculum that involves students in scenarios where they use it--no more worksheets!!!
- 👀 I’m interested in video games and design and dev to spark my curriculum into scintillation! I educate students in math/ELA literacy, and other subjects integrated for grades 1-12.
- 🌱 I’m self-taught dev/design, and currently learning everything (inc. git, godot 4, gd script, blender, terminal, etc). I learn what I need to do to make my curriculum come to life and get gamified!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you will help me with lol, and whatever I can help you with! Anything that helps me integrate curriculum truly into a game, so it doesn't feel like "school".
- 📫 How to reach me? At Work: cc.lawhon@epiccharterschools.org  or At Home Studio: info@cclawhon.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: cows make me sad, glitter makes me happy

Everything in my gameDev folder is not yet sharable. It's copyrighted 2024 no copy/share/do not use. However, as I learn how all this works, I'll be adding all my code from my game and some scenes of my game in a public repository--assets/code/etc that are either someone else's (sharealike), open source, or my original work and you're welcome to use and change to fit your needs! When I learn something I think would help others, I'll either put a mini-tut on reddit (@OhEvolve) or I'll add a repository for it, make a YouTube short, or I'll link to it :)
